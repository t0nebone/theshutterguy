    quote: "I cannot offer a higher review than the one I am leaving right now. Frank knows his business! He and his assistant came and took measurements, listened to what we wanted and explained several options. They worked inside our existing crown molding and did not have to cover it. Installation was less than one day. They're very friendly and respectful. The shutters are absolutely beautiful. 5 Stars!",

No one I called did wooden shutters anymore due to expense, but one person told me to try The Shutter Guy. He was so nice, polite and came right out. The price was much lower than expected. I'm so happy I found Frank!",
